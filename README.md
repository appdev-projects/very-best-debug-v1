# Very Best Debug

## Standard Workflow

  1. Welcome to your first Debug assignment 
  1. The goal of this assignment is to make the code work by correcting all of the bugs that are contained within
  1. Checkout the target to see how your code should function
  1. Run `rails dev:prime` to populate your database
  1. Run `rails grade` to see everything that is currently broken
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
 1. Run `rails grade` as often as you like to see how you are doing, but **make sure you test your app manually first to make sure it matches the target's behavior first**.
