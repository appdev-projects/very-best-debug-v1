# Very Best Debug

Here is the [target app]()

## Debug each RCAV!
There are 11 routes in this application. Currently, none of them work. Each RCAV is broken in some way.

- Visit each route and **READ ANY ERROR MESSAGES YOU FIND**.
- Once you've read and understood the error, debug the Route/Controller/Action/View and make the app function like the target.
- Refer to the [routing chapter]() if you need a reminder on RCAV.
- Examine the target to see how the app should behave.
- Run `rails grade` when you are confident you've debugged a page. 

## Standard Workflow

  1. Welcome to your first Debug assignment 
  1. The goal of this assignment is to make the code work by correcting all of the bugs that are contained within
  1. Checkout the target to see how your code should function
  1. Run `rails dev:prime` to populate your database
  1. Run `rails grade` to see everything that is currently broken
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
 1. Run `rails grade` as often as you like to see how you are doing, but **make sure you test your app manually first to make sure it matches the target's behavior first**.
