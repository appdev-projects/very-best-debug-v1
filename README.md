# Very Best Debug

Here is the [target app](https://very-best-debug.matchthetarget.com/)

## Standard Workflow

  1. Welcome to your first Debug assignment 
  1. The goal of this assignment is to make the code work by correcting all of the bugs that are contained within
  1. Checkout the target to see how your code should function
  1. Run `rails dev:prime` to populate your database
  1. Start with visiting the route `/users`
  1. You will see an error message, [**READ THE ERROR MESSAGE**](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/754#read-the-error-message-rtem)
  1. When you understand the error message, work to figure out a solution to fix the error so the Route/Controller/Action/View function like the target.
  1. Remember that the error will guide you to the bug and our skills as developers are determined by how many bugs we understand how to fix
  1. Refer to the [routing chapter](https://chapters.firstdraft.com/chapters/772) if you are stuck on the RCAV
  1. Once you have `/users` working correctly, check the routes file and get each working the same as the target
  1. Run `rails grade` once all the routes are working to see what else still does not match the target
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
 1. Run `rails grade` as often as you like to see how you are doing, but **make sure you test your app manually first to make sure it matches the target's behavior first**.
